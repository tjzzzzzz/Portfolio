              Hi, I'm TJ, a 19-year-old self-taught programmer from Finland with a background in the military. 
              I've been programming for 3â€“4 years, primarily as a hobby. Currently, I'm in my first year of 
              software engineering at university.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about learning new technologies, building projects, and improving my skills 
              through hands-on experience. My journey in programming started with curiosity and has evolved 
              into a deep passion for creating meaningful solutions.
            </p>
